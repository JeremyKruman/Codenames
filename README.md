# Codenames
Java applet for the Codenames board game

If you are unable to compile the source code, the precompiled Codenames.jar file can be used.

The game is fully functional. However, not all board layouts have been implemented. As a result, the Blue Team always plays first.

Original game by Vlaada Chvatil
